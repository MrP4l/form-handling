# form-handling

I got back to PHP after almost a year, after some initial difficulties, I tried for the first time to manage a registration form for a hypothetical site where companies can register and enter a private area and consequently also a login form. For some elements I helped myself with bootstrap, such as the forms and the private area navbar. Surely some elements to manage in the backend are missing, such as some controls of the values obtained with the forms, cookies, the possibility of modifying the registration data, etc. Graphically the homepage (index.php) didn't look bad, instead the private area (privateArea.php) was done very quickly.
